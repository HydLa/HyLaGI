Mathlink License Agreement

Pursuant to this Limited License Agreement ("Agreement") Wolfram
Research, Inc. ("WRI") grants you ("Licensee"), free of charge, a
nonexclusive, perpetual license to use, copy, and distribute MathLink
("the Program") for the purpose of enhancing the Mathematicaﾂｮ
interoperability of certain Licensee products and services ("Licensee
Work"), provided that such use or distribution does not violate the
terms of this Agreement.

1. Program Use 
Licensee can download, install, and use the
Program. Licensee is permitted to distribute the Program for
noncommercial purposes, provided that this Agreement is included with
each such copy distributed. Any person or entity who obtains or uses a
copy of the Program under or through this Agreement agrees to be bound
thereby.

2. Ownership
The Program and related user documentation are proprietary
products of WRI and are protected under U.S. copyright law. All right,
title, and interest in and to the Program, including associated
intellectual property rights, are and shall remain with WRI. This
Agreement does not convey to Licensee an interest in or to the
Program, but only a limited right to use the Program, revocable in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

3. Restrictions 
Licensee agrees not to reverse assemble, reverse compile,
or otherwise translate the Program. Licensee may not use, copy,
modify, or distribute the Program (electronically or otherwise), or
any copy, adaptation, transcription, or merged portion thereof, except
as expressly authorized by this Agreement.

4. No Warranty 
The Program is being delivered "as is" and WRI makes no
warranty as to its use or performance. WRI and its suppliers do not
and cannot warrant the performance or results licensee may obtain by
using the program. Wri and its suppliers make no warranties, express
or implied, as to non-infringement of third-party rights,
merchantability, or fitness for any particular purpose. In no event
will WRI or its suppliers be liable to licensee for any consequential,
incidental, or special damages, including any lost profits or lost
savings, even if a WRI representative has been advised of the
possibility of such damages, or for any claim by any third party.

Some states or jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation
of incidental, consequential, or special damages, or the exclusion of
implied warranties or limitations on how long an implied warranty may
last, so that all or some of the above limitations may not apply to
all Licensees.

5. Jurisdictions
This Agreement will be governed by the laws of the State
of Illinois, USA, excluding the application of its conflicts of law
rules. Application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for
the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded.

6. Waiver, Severability, and Merger 
The failure of either party to
enforce any rights granted hereunder or to take action against the
other party in the event of any breach hereunder shall not be deemed a
waiver by that party as to subsequent enforcement of rights or
subsequent actions in the event of future breaches. If any part of
this Agreement is found void and unenforceable, it will not affect the
validity of the balance of the Agreement, which shall remain valid and
enforceable according to its terms. This Agreement is the full and
final expression of the intent of the parties with respect to the
subject matter herein; this Agreement supersedes any prior or
contemporaneous discussions, agreements, or representations by or
between the parties hereto.

7. Export
Licensee agrees not to ship or otherwise permit distribution of
the Program into any country or for any use prohibited by the United
States Export Administration Act or any other export laws,
restrictions, or regulations.

8. Term and Termination 
This Agreement is effective upon Licensee's
execution of this Agreement, and shall continue until terminated. WRI
may terminate this Agreement immediately in the event of any breach by
Licensee of any term hereof. Upon such termination by WRI, Licensee
agrees to destroy all copies or portions of the Program under its
control.

9. Notice to Government End Users 
The Program is a "Commercial Item," as
that term is defined at 48 C.F.R. ﾃつｧ2.101, consisting of "Commercial
Computer Software" and "Commercial Computer Software Documentation,"
as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. ﾃつｧ12.212 or 48
C.F.R. ﾃつｧ227.7202, as applicable. Consistent with 48 C.F.R. ﾃつｧ12.212
or 48 C.F.R. ﾃつｧﾃつｧ227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4, as applicable, the
Commercial Computer Software and Commercial Computer Software
Documentation are being licensed to U.S. Government end users (A) only
as Commercial Items and (B) with only those rights as are granted to
all other end users pursuant to the terms and conditions herein.

10. Commercial Licenses 
Requests for Licenses to distribute the Program
for commercial purposes should be directed to Legal Administration at
Wolfram Research, 100 Trade Center Drive, Champaign, IL 61820, or by
email to info@wolfram.com.

Please note that Wolfram Research's standard license agreements
prohibit access to Mathematica through internet sites. Refer to the
Mathematica License Agreement for further details. Information on
licensing options for internet usage is available from WRI and our
international resellers.

This Agreement may only be modified in writing, with the signature of
an authorized officer of WRI.
